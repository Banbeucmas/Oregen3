# Configuration link: https://github.com/xHexed/Oregen3/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.yml
# Please click this link if you use the plugin the first time or updating from an old version
# Generator options:
#   - random: list of blocks that will randomly be chosen upon generating ores, defaults to air (stops the liquid from flowing)
#   - permission: The permission it will use instead of the default provided one, defaults to oregen3.generator.<generator name>
#   - sound: sound options when block is being generated
#     - name: Defaults to BLOCK_FIRE_EXTINGUISH. You can use old sound enums,
#             as long as it playable in your server version (ex: 1.8 sound names for 1.12 server)
#     - volume: Range from 0.0 to 2.0 (defaults to 1)
#     - pitch: Same as volume
#   - world: World-related options
#     - blacklist: Controls if the generator can only generate in the list provided (true) or vise-versa (false)
#     - list: defaults to an empty list
